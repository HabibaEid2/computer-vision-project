## Project Idea : Face Detection and Recognition

**Description:** : A Python-based program that automatically locate and identify human faces within images or videos.This technology is widely used in cameras, security systems, mobile apps, and AI applications to enable features like autofocus and facial recognition ..

**Objectives:**
- Develop a model capable of accurately detecting faces in images and videos.
- Ensure fast and reliable real-time detection performance.
- Build a simple and interactive user interface to display results in real-time.

**Scope:** 
- In Scope: Face detection, real-time processing, simple UI, performance testing.
- Out of Scope: Facial expression recognition or storing user data.
